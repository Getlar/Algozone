    "\n",
    "- Read in and ignore any leading `whitespace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read in next the characters until the next `non-digit` character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert these digits into an integer `(i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32)`. If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.\n",
